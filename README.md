## Profile

I completed a masters degree in Mathematics at the University of Bristol before moving to Leeds to start a PhD in October 2017, under the supervision of Michael Rathjen and Andrew Brooke-Taylor, which I completed in 2021. After that I was a postdoc at the University of Leeds until October 2022. I am currently a post doc, working with Laura Fontanella at the Universit\'{e} Paris-Est Cr\'{e}teil.
